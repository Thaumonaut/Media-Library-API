Setup dependencies

npm install --save-dev jest
npm instal --save-dev supertest
npm install --save-dev @shelf/jest-mongodb


Folder __tests__ :

folder to add files with the following format "example.test.js"
For example, if you wanna test information about books route you might write : booksRoutes.test.js
Here, we are going to import functions from src files to compose our tests files.


Folder src :

Folder where we can put files with functions that will be used in __tests__ files.

By defult, jest will looking for files in __tests__ folder. Then, if you don1t put anything there, it's gonna fail.
